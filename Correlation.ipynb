    "   - **Spearmanr**: Wikipedia Definition: In statistics, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient or Spearman’s ρ, named after Charles Spearman is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a <u>monotonic function</u>.\n",
